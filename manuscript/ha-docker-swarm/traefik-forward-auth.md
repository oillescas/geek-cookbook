# Traefik Forward Auth

Now that we have Traefik deployed, automatically exposing SSL access to our Docker Swarm services using LetsEncrypt wildcard certificates, let's pause to consider that we may not _want_ some services exposed directly to the internet...

..Wait, why not? Well, Traefik doesn't provide any form of authentication, it simply secures the **transmission** of the service between Docker Swarm and the end user. If you were to deploy a service with no native security (*[Radarr](/recipes/autopirate/radarr/) or [Sonarr](/recipes/autopirate/sonarr/) come to mind*), then anybody would be able to use it! Even services which _may_ have a layer of authentication **might** not be safe to expose publically - often open source projects may be maintained by enthusiasts who happily add extra features, but just pay lip service to security, on the basis that "*it's the user's problem to secure it in their own network*".

To give us confidence that **we** can access our services, but BadGuys(tm) cannot, we'll deploy a layer of authentication **in front** of Traefik, using [Forward Authentication](https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/entrypoints/#forward-authentication). You can use your own  [KeyCloak](/recipes/keycloak/) instance for authentication, but to lower the barrier to entry, this recipe will assume you're authenticating against your own Google account.

## Ingredients

!!! summary "Ingredients"
    Existing:

    * [X] [Docker swarm cluster](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/ha-docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph)
    * [X] [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik/) configured per design

    New:

    * [ ] Client ID and secret from an OpenID-Connect provider (Google, [KeyCloak](/recipes/keycloak/), Microsoft, etc..)

## Preparation

### Obtain OAuth credentials

!!! note
    This recipe will demonstrate using Google OAuth for traefik forward authentication, but it's also possible to use a self-hosted KeyCloak instance - see the [KeyCloak OIDC Provider](/recipes/keycloak/setup-oidc-provider/) recipe for more details!

Log into https://console.developers.google.com/, create a new project then search for and select "Credentials" in the search bar. 

Fill out the "OAuth Consent Screen" tab, and then click, "**Create Credentials**" > "**OAuth client ID**". Select "**Web Application**", fill in the name of your app, skip "**Authorized JavaScript origins**" and fill "**Authorized redirect URIs**" with either all the domains you will allow authentication from, appended with the url-path (*e.g. https://radarr.example.com/_oauth, https://radarr.example.com/_oauth, etc*), or if you don't like frustration, use a "auth host" URL instead, like "*https://auth.example.com/_oauth*" (*see below for details*)

!!! tip
    Store your client ID and secret safely - you'll need them for the next step.


### Prepare environment

Create `/var/data/config/traefik-forward-auth/traefik-forward-auth.env` as follows:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your client id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your client secret>
OIDC_ISSUER=https://accounts.google.com
SECRET=<a random string, make it up>
# uncomment this to use a single auth host instead of individual redirect_uris (recommended but advanced)
#AUTH_HOST=auth.example.com
COOKIE_DOMAINS=example.com
```

### Prepare the docker service config

Create `/var/data/config/traefik-forward-auth/traefik-forward-auth.yml` as follows:

```
  traefik-forward-auth:
    image: thomseddon/traefik-forward-auth:2.1.0
    env_file: /var/data/config/traefik-forward-auth/traefik-forward-auth.env
    networks:
      - traefik_public
    # Uncomment these lines if you're using auth host mode
    #deploy:
    #  labels:
    #    - traefik.port=4181
    #    - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:auth.example.com
    #    - traefik.frontend.auth.forward.address=http://traefik-forward-auth:4181
    #    - traefik.frontend.auth.forward.trustForwardHeader=true
```

If you're not confident that forward authentication is working, add a simple "whoami" test container to the above .yml, to help debug traefik forward auth, before attempting to add it to a more complex container.

```
  # This simply validates that traefik forward authentication is working
  whoami:
    image: containous/whoami
    networks:
      - traefik_public
    deploy:
      labels:
        - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:whoami.example.com
        - traefik.port=80
        - traefik.frontend.auth.forward.address=http://traefik-forward-auth:4181
        - traefik.frontend.auth.forward.authResponseHeaders=X-Forwarded-User
        - traefik.frontend.auth.forward.trustForwardHeader=true
```

!!! tip
        I share (_with my [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/funkypenguin)_) a private "_premix_" git repository, which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that sponsors can launch any recipe with just a ```git pull``` and a ```docker stack deploy``` üëç



## Serving

### Launch

Redeploy traefik with ```docker stack deploy traefik-forward-auth -c /var/data/traefik-forward-auth/traefik-forward-auth.yml```, to launch the traefik-forward-auth stack. 

### Test

Browse to https://whoami.example.com (*obviously, customized for your domain and having created a DNS record*), and all going according to plan, you should be redirected to a Google login. Once successfully logged in, you'll be directed to the basic whoami page.

## Summary

What have we achieved? By adding an additional three simple labels to any service, we can secure any service behind our choice of OAuth provider, with minimal processing / handling overhead.

!!! summary "Summary"
    Created:

    * [X] Traefik-forward-auth configured to authenticate against an OIDC provider



## Chef's Notes üìì

1. Traefik forward auth replaces the use of [oauth_proxy containers](/reference/oauth_proxy/) found in some of the existing recipes
2. I reviewed several implementations of forward authenticators for Traefik, but found most to be rather heavy-handed, or specific to a single auth provider. @thomaseddon's go-based docker image is 7MB in size, and can be extended to work with any OIDC provider.
