# phpIPAM

phpIPAM is an open-source web IP address management application (_IPAM_). Its goal is to provide light, modern and useful IP address management. It is php-based application with MySQL database backend, using jQuery libraries, ajax and HTML5/CSS3 features.

![phpIPAM Screenshot](../images/phpipam.png)

phpIPAM fulfils a non-sexy, but important role - It helps you manage your IP address allocation.

## Why should you care about this?

You probably have a home network, with 20-30 IP addresses, for your family devices, your ![IoT devices](/recipe/home-assistant), your smart TV, etc. If you want to (a) monitor them, and (b) audit who does what, you care about what IPs they're assigned by your DHCP server.

You could simple keep track of all devices with leases in your DHCP server, but what happens if your (_hypothetical?_) Ubiquity Edge Router X crashes and burns due to lack of disk space, and you loose track of all your leases? Well, you have to start from scratch, is what!

And that [HomeAssistant](/recipes/homeassistant/) config, which you so carefully compiled, refers to each device by IP/DNS name, so you'd better make sure you recreate it consistently!

Enter phpIPAM. A tool designed to help home keeps as well as large organisations keep track of their IP (_and VLAN, VRF, and AS number_) allocations.

## Ingredients

1. [Docker swarm cluster](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/ha-docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph.md)
2. [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik_public) configured per design
3. DNS entry for the hostname (_i.e. "phpipam.your-domain.com"_) you intend to use for phpIPAM, pointed to your [keepalived](ha-docker-swarm/keepalived/) IPIP

## Preparation

### Setup data locations

We'll need several directories to bind-mount into our container, so create them in /var/data/phpipam:

```
mkdir /var/data/phpipam/databases-dump -p
mkdir /var/data/runtime/phpipam -p
```

### Prepare environment

Create phpipam.env, and populate with the following variables
```
# Setup for github, phpipam application
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID=
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET=
OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET=

# For MariaDB/MySQL database
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=imtoosecretformyshorts
MYSQL_DATABASE=phpipam
MYSQL_USER=phpipam
MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret

# phpIPAM-specific variables
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_USER=phpipam
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_DB=phpipam
MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_HOST=db

# For backup
BACKUP_NUM_KEEP=7
BACKUP_FREQUENCY=1d
```

Additionally, create phpipam-backup.env, and populate with the following variables:

```
# For MariaDB/MySQL database
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=imtoosecretformyshorts
MYSQL_DATABASE=phpipam
MYSQL_USER=phpipam
MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret

# For backup
BACKUP_NUM_KEEP=7
BACKUP_FREQUENCY=1d
```

### Create nginx.conf

I usually protect my stacks using an [oauth proxy](/reference/oauth_proxy/) container in front of the app. This protects me from either accidentally exposing a platform to the world, or having a insecure platform accessed and abused.

In the case of phpIPAM, the oauth_proxy creates an additional complexity, since it passes the "Authorization" HTTP header to the phpIPAM container. phpIPAH then examines the header, determines that the provided username (_my email address associated with my oauth provider_) doesn't match a local user account, and denies me access without the opportunity to retry.

The (_dirty_) solution I've come up with is to insert an Nginx instance in the path between the oauth_proxy and the phpIPAM container itself. Nginx can remove the authorization header, so that phpIPAM can prompt me to login with a web-based form.

Create /var/data/phpipam/nginx.conf as follows:


```
upstream app-upstream {
    server app:80;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ~.;

    # Just redirect everything to the upstream
    # Yes, it's embarassing. We are just a mechanism to strip an AUTH header :(
    location ^~ / {
        proxy_pass http://app-upstream;
	proxy_set_header       Authorization "";
    }

}
```

### Setup Docker Swarm

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like this:

!!! tip
        I share (_with my [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/funkypenguin)_) a private "_premix_" git repository, which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that sponsors can launch any recipe with just a ```git pull``` and a ```docker stack deploy``` üëç

  # Wait, what? Why do we have an oauth_proxy _and_ an nginx frontend for a simple webapp?
  # Well, it's a long story. Basically, the phpipam container sees the "auth" headers passed by the
  # oauth_proxy, and decides to use these exclusively to authenticate users. So no web-based login form, just "access denied"
  # To work around this, we add nginx reverse proxy to the mix. A PITA, but an easy way to solve without altering the PHPIPAM code

!!! note
    Setup unique static subnets for every stack you deploy. This avoids IP/gateway conflicts which can otherwise occur when you're creating/removing stacks a lot. See [my list](/reference/networks/) here.



## Serving

### Launch phpIPAM stack

Launch the phpIPAM stack by running ```docker stack deploy phpipam -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>```

Log into your new instance at https://**YOUR-FQDN**, and follow the on-screen prompts to set your first user/password.

## Chef's Notes üìì

1. If you wanted to expose the phpIPAM UI directly, you could remove the oauth2_proxy and the nginx services from the design, and move the traefik_public-related labels directly to the phpipam container. You'd also need to add the traefik_public network to the phpipam container.
