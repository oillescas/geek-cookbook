!!! tip "Sponsored Project"
    Sonarr is one of my [sponsored projects](/sponsored-projects/) - a project I financially support on a regular basis because of its utility to me. I forget it's there until I (reliably) receive an email with new and exciting updates üòÅ

## Inclusion into AutoPirate

To include Radarr in your [AutoPirate](/recipes/autopirate/) stack, include the following in your autopirate.yml stack definition file:

````
radarr:
  image: linuxserver/radarr:latest
  env_file : /var/data/config/autopirate/radarr.env
  volumes:
   - /var/data/autopirate/radarr:/config
   - /var/data/media:/media
  networks:
  - internal

radarr_proxy:
  image: a5huynh/oauth2_proxy
  env_file : /var/data/config/autopirate/radarr.env
  networks:
    - internal
    - traefik_public
  deploy:
    labels:
      - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:radarr.example.com
      - traefik.docker.network=traefik_public
      - traefik.port=4180
  volumes:
    - /var/data/config/autopirate/authenticated-emails.txt:/authenticated-emails.txt
  command: |
    -cookie-secure=false
    -upstream=http://radarr:7878
    -redirect-url=https://radarr.example.com
    -http-address=http://0.0.0.0:4180
    -email-domain=example.com
    -provider=github
    -authenticated-emails-file=/authenticated-emails.txt
````

!!! tip
    I share (_with my [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/funkypenguin)_) a private "_premix_" git repository, which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that sponsors can launch any recipe with just a ```git pull``` and a ```docker stack deploy``` üëç

## Chef's Notes üìì

1. In many cases, tools will integrate with each other. I.e., Radarr needs to talk to SABnzbd and NZBHydra, Ombi needs to talk to Radarr, etc. Since each tool runs within the stack under its own name, just refer to each tool by name (i.e. "radarr"), and docker swarm will resolve the name to the appropriate container. You can identify the tool-specific port by looking at the docker-compose service definition.
