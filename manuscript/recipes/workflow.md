The workflow for creating a recipe

1. In my gitlab repo for the cookbook, I create an issue to track the new recipe I want to create
2. From the issue, I create a branch
3. I pull the branch locally, "git pull" followed by "git co <branch>"
4. I "git add" my changes, commit, and push the branch
5. I create a merge request in the branch to track merging into produced
6. I set request to merge when pipeline succeeds
