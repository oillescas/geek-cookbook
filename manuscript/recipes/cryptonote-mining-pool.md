# CryptoNote Mining Pool

[Cryptocurrency miners](/recipes/cryptominer) will "pool" their GPU resources ("_hashpower_") into aggregate "_mining pools_", so that by the combined effort of all the miners, the pool will receive a reward for the blocks "mined" into the blockchain, and this reward will be distributed among the miners.

[CryptoNote](https://cryptonote.org/) is an open-source toolset designed to facilitate the creation of new privacy-focused  [cryptocurrencies](https://cryptonote.org/coins)

(_CryptoNote = 'Kryptonite'. In a pool. Get it?_)
