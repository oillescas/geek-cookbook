hero: AutoPirate - A fully-featured recipe to automate finding, downloading, and organising your media ðŸ“º ðŸŽ¥ ðŸŽµ ðŸ“–

# AutoPirate

Once the cutting edge of the "internet" (_pre-world-wide-web and mosiac days_), Usenet is now a murky, geeky alternative to torrents for file-sharing. However, it's **cool** geeky, especially if you're into having a fully automated media platform.

A good starter for the usenet scene is https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/. Because it's so damn complicated, a host of automated tools exist to automate the process of finding, downloading, and managing content. The tools included in this recipe are as follows:

This recipe presents a method to combine these tools into a single swarm deployment, and make them available securely.

## Menu

Tools included in the AutoPirate stack are:

* **[SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org)** : downloads data from usenet servers based on .nzb definitions
* **[NZBGet](https://nzbget.net/)** : downloads data from usenet servers based on .nzb definitions, but written in C++ and designed with performance in mind to achieve maximum download speed by using very little system resources (_this is a popular alternative to SABnzbd_)
* **[RTorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki)** is a CLI-based torrent client, which when combined with **[ruTorrent](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent)** becomes a powerful and fully browser-managed torrent client. (_Yes, it's not Usenet, but Sonarr/Radarr will let fulfill your watchlist using either Usenet **or** torrents, so it's worth including_)
* **[NZBHydra](https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra)** : acts as a "meta-indexer", so that your downloading tools (_radarr, sonarr, etc_) only need to be setup for a single indexes. Also produces interesting stats on indexers, which helps when evaluating which indexers are performing well.
* **[NZBHydra2](https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2)** : is a high-performance rewrite of the original NZBHydra, with extra features. While still in beta, this NZBHydra2 will eventually supercede NZBHydra
* **[Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv)** : finds, downloads and manages TV shows
* **[Radarr](https://radarr.video)** : finds, downloads and manages movies
* **[Mylar](https://github.com/evilhero/mylar)** : finds, downloads and manages comic books
* **[Headphones](https://github.com/rembo10/headphones)** : finds, downloads and manages music
* **[Lazy Librarian](https://github.com/itsmegb/LazyLibrarian)** : finds, downloads and manages ebooks
* **[Ombi](https://github.com/tidusjar/Ombi)** : provides an interface to request additions to a [Plex](/recipes/plex/)/[Emby](/recipes/emby/)/[Jellyfin](/recipes/jellyfin/) library using the above tools
* **[Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett)** : Provides an local, caching, API-based interface to torrent trackers, simplifying the way your tools search for torrents.

Since this recipe is so long, and so many of the tools are optional to the final result (_i.e., if you're not interested in comics, you won't want Mylar_), I've described each individual tool on its own sub-recipe page (_below_), even though most of them are deployed very similarly.


## Ingredients

1. [Docker swarm cluster](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/ha-docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph.md)
2. [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik) configured per design
3. Access to NZB indexers and Usenet servers
4. DNS entries configured for each of the NZB tools in this recipe that you want to use

## Preparation

### Setup data locations

We'll need a unique directories for each tool in the stack, bind-mounted into our containers, so create them upfront, in /var/data/autopirate:

```
mkdir /var/data/autopirate
cd /var/data/autopirate
mkdir -p {lazylibrarian,mylar,ombi,sonarr,radarr,headphones,plexpy,nzbhydra,sabnzbd,nzbget,rtorrent,jackett}
```

Create a directory for the storage of your downloaded media, i.e., something like:

```
mkdir /var/data/media
```

Create a user to "own" the above directories, and note the uid and gid of the created user. You'll need to specify the UID/GID in the environment variables passed to the container (in the example below, I used 4242 - twice the meaning of life).

### Secure public access

What you'll quickly notice about this recipe is that __every__ web interface is protected by an [OAuth proxy](/reference/oauth_proxy/).

Why? Because these tools are developed by a handful of volunteer developers who are focused on adding features, not necessarily implementing robust security. Most users wouldn't expose these tools directly to the internet, so the tools have rudimentary (if any) access control.

To mitigate the risk associated with public exposure of these tools (_you're on your smartphone and you want to add a movie to your watchlist, what do you do, hotshot?_), in order to gain access to each tool you'll first need to authenticate against your given OAuth provider.

This is tedious, but you only have to do it once. Each tool (Sonarr, Radarr, etc) to be protected by an OAuth proxy, requires unique configuration. I use github to provide my oauth, giving each tool a unique logo while I'm at it (make up your own random string for OAUTH2PROXYCOOKIE_SECRET)

For each tool, create /var/data/autopirate/<tool>.env, and set the following:

```
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID=
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET=
OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET=
PUID=4242
PGID=4242
```

Create at least /var/data/autopirate/authenticated-emails.txt, containing at least your own email address with your OAuth provider. If you wanted to grant access to a specific tool to other users, you'd need a unique authenticated-emails-<tool>.txt which included both normal email address as well as any addresses to be granted tool-specific access.

### Setup components

#### Stack basics

**Start** with a swarm config file in docker-compose syntax, like this:

````
version: '3'

services:
````

And **end** with a stanza like this:

````
networks:
  traefik_public:
    external: true
  internal:
    driver: overlay
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.16.11.0/24
````

!!! note
    Setup unique static subnets for every stack you deploy. This avoids IP/gateway conflicts which can otherwise occur when you're creating/removing stacks a lot. See [my list](/reference/networks/) here.

#### Assemble the tools..

Now work your way through the list of tools below, adding whichever tools your want to use, and finishing with the **end** section:
