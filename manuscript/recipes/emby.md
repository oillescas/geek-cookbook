# Emby

[Emby](https://emby.media/) (_think "M.B." or "Media Browser"_) is best described as "_like [Plex](/recipes/plex/) but different_" üòÅ - It's a bit geekier and less polished than Plex, but it allows for more flexibility and customization.

![Emby Screenshot](../images/emby.png)

I've started experimenting with Emby as an alternative to Plex, because of the advanced [parental controls](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Parental-Controls) it offers. Based on my experimentation thus far, I have a "**kid-safe**" profile which automatically logs in, and only displays kid-safe content, based on ratings.

## Ingredients

1. [Docker swarm cluster](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/ha-docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph.md)
2. [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik) configured per design
3. DNS entry for the hostname you intend to use, pointed to your [keepalived](ha-docker-swarm/keepalived/) IP

## Preparation

### Setup data locations

We'll need a location to store Emby's library data, config files, logs and temporary transcoding space, so create /var/data/emby, and make sure it's owned by the user and group who also own your media data.

```
mkdir /var/data/emby
```

### Prepare environment

Create emby.env, and populate with PUID/GUID for the user who owns the /var/data/emby directory (_above_) and your actual media content (_in this example, the media content is at **/srv/data**_)

```
PUID=
GUID=
```

### Setup Docker Swarm

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like this:

!!! tip
        I share (_with my [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/funkypenguin)_) a private "_premix_" git repository, which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that sponsors can launch any recipe with just a ```git pull``` and a ```docker stack deploy``` üëç


```
version: "3.0"

services:
  emby:
    image: emby/emby-server
    env_file: /var/data/config/emby/emby.env
    volumes:
      - /var/data/emby/emby:/config
      - /srv/data/:/data
    deploy:
      labels:
        - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:emby.example.com
        - traefik.docker.network=traefik_public
        - traefik.port=8096
    networks:
        - traefik_public
        - internal
    ports:
      - 8096:8096

networks:
  traefik_public:
    external: true
  internal:
    driver: overlay
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.16.17.0/24
```

!!! note
    Setup unique static subnets for every stack you deploy. This avoids IP/gateway conflicts which can otherwise occur when you're creating/removing stacks a lot. See [my list](/reference/networks/) here.



## Serving

### Launch Emby stack

Launch the stack by running ```docker stack deploy emby -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>```

Log into your new instance at https://**YOUR-FQDN**, and complete the wizard-based setup to complete deploying your Emby.

## Chef's Notes üìì

1. I didn't use an [oauth2_proxy](/reference/oauth_proxy/) for this stack, because it would interfere with mobile client support.
2. Got an NVIDIA GPU? See [this blog post](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/note/gpu-transcoding-with-emby-plex-using-docker-nvidia/) re how to use your GPU to transcode your media!
3. We don't bother exposing the HTTPS port for Emby, since [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik/) is doing the SSL termination for us already.
